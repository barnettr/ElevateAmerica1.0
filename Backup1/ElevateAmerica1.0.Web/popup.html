			Microsoft is committed to strengthening the U.S. economy and increasing global competitiveness by improving access to education and workforce readiness skills required for twenty-first  century jobs. To support this commitment, we launched Elevate America, an initiative designed to provide 1 million vouchers for Microsoft E-Learning courses and select Microsoft Certification exams at no cost to recipients. Elevate America will be implemented in partnership with states across the country as part of our overall effort to help train 2 million people over the next three years.
